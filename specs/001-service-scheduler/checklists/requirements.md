# Specification Quality Checklist: Unified Service Scheduler

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-11-02
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items passed on the first validation pass. Technology choices (mock library, storage,
  framework) are intentionally deferred to `/speckit-plan`.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers: ambiguous points (auth, reschedule, working hours, alternative
  search horizon, assignment strategy) were resolved with documented defaults in Assumptions and
  FR-008/FR-010. Run `/speckit-clarify` to challenge these defaults before planning.
